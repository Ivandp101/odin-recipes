        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Seerabeh is a tangy walnut and verjuice-based northern Persian sauce typically served with fish.
         <br>  It can also be thickened slightly and used as a dip with crisp veggies and flatbreads.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 cup walnuts, finely ground to a paste</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed to a paste</li>
            <li>3/4 cup verjuice (plus more as needed)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground tumeric</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Handful of fresh cilantro, tough stems trimmed, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Fresh mint</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Place the walnut paste in a medium pan.</li>
            <li>Gently roast over medium heat, stirring often, 
                until fragrant, about 5 minutes. Take care nit to burn it.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, verjuice, salt, tumeric and pepper. 
                Be careful: the verjuice will split as soon as it hits the hot pan.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer the sauce until it slightly thickens
                (it will thicken more as it sits), about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the sauce to a bowl.</li>
            <li>Stir in the cilantro and set aside to cool for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Taste and add another splash of verjuice, and some salt and pepper if needed. 
                It will most likely need it.</li>
            <li>Cover and let rest in the fridge for a day or two before serving.</li>

        </ol>
