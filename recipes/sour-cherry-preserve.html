        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>This sour cherry preserve is delicious served with feta cheese on crostini as a wonderful Persian-inspired breakfast.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sour cherries, pitted</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lime juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon rose water (optional)</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Place the sour cherries in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the sugar and mix.</li>
            <li>Partially cover and set aside for 3 hours or overnight to macerate.</li>
            <li>Place the macerated cherries in a heavy-bottomed medium pan, and add the lime juice.</li>
            <li>Bring to a quick boil over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to medium low and simmer, stirring often - about 20-25 minutes until cherries soften.</li>
            <li>After this simmering, the mixture will have thickened, so now transfer the cherries to a glass jar.</li>
            <li>Keep reducing the juices for another five minutes, bearing in mind that the preserves will condsiderably thicken as they cool.</li>
            <li>Pour the juices over the cherries and add the rose water.</li>
            <li>Stir and set aside to cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Cover and refrigerate. </li>
            <li>Preserves should last up to a month in the fridge.</li>


        </ol>
